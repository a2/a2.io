My talk at NSSpain was about disassembly and how developers can reach into the internals of Apple's and other frameworks to see implementation details and hidden functionality. I also gave a workshop at NSSpain related to my talk where we went in-depth into the private Sharing framework and we reverse-engineered AirDrop.
