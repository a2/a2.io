In the programmer fashion of ["Hello, world!" programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), I have thus titled my first post on this blog. (Although technically, this post is more of a "hello _again_." This is not my first post ever, but rather my first in a long, long time.)

I hope to post longer-form content here, either about iOS development or technology as a whole. As anyone who knows me will attest, I have no shortage of things to say. In fact, sometimes I even have too much to say. Hopefully this blog will be a nice outlet (or, _@IBOutlet_ ðŸ˜‰) for such thoughts.

I'd like to post something interesting every once in a while. In case this remains my only post here  my normal rantings can be found on my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/a2). I hope to see you again soon, perhaps when I have something more to say.
